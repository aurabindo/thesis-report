#Dependencies


This will only work on a linux based OS like Fedora/Ubuntu/Arch, etc.

If you are on a faster internet connection, install the full latex suite.
Else see report/README.

#Usage

To compile both report and the presentation, run (in this directory):

```
make
```
This will compile the latex source for both the report and presentation
and create a PDF output. It will also open the resulting file
in evince document viewer.

To individially compile either the report or the presentation alone,
you can use as the target. For example:

```
make report
```
or
```
make presentation
```
No need to type in `presentation` fully. You can use tab completion.

To clean:

```
make clean
```
