Make sure you have full latex suite installed. If not,
install the minimal latex package and then compile to
see what all packages latex complains as missing and
then install them individually. You will save a lot of
space (and downloading time) at the cost of time needed
to figure out whats missing.

To make it easier, look for the`\usepackage` directives
inside the source (tex) files and try installing those.
Most of them should be available in the same name with
some distro specific suffixes or prefixes.

Installing packages in Linux is quite easy if you 
use OS's package manager like apt for ubuntu or  
dnf for fedora. If you are new to linux, let me
advice you that the way you have done software
installation in windows is not the way you do it in linux.
Always prefer installing application with the system's
package manager, which is apt for Ubuntu & Debian,
dnf for Fedora, pacman  for Arch, and so on.
