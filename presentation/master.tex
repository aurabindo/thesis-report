\hspace{6mm} When Android framework was getting developed, systems using ARM core and
corresponding sub system architecture were widely used. As the ARM ecosystem evolved,
it established itself as one of the leading vehicle for Android platform. Consequently,
Android ecosystem also developed around ARM architecture including application
development, services and even system level optimization. When x86 core also entered
this Android ecosystem, effort was put in to make system level optimization for
Android products based on x86 Architecture.

This thesis aims at evaluating various known methods as well as finding new areas
for optimization. Optimization effort will be targeting at reducing the boot time of
the the system by evaluating various components which includes BIOS firmware,
Bootloader, Linux Kernel and other AOSP components.
