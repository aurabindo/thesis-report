This directory contains sources for the official report.
To compile, run make. Only tested on Linux. 
Make sure you have full latex suite installed. If not,
install the minimal latex package and then compile to
see what all packages latex complains as missing and
then install them individually. You will save a lot of
space (and downloading time) at the cost of time needed
to figure out whats missing.
